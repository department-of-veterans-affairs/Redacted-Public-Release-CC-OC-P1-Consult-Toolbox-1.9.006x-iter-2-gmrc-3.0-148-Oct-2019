Repository containing the CIF submission for Community Care (CC) One Consult Phase 1, Consult Toolbox 1.9.006x, iter 2, GMRC*3.0*148 received Oct 2019.

The project will create a single consult that can be forwarded as needed to schedule a patient for an episode of care instead of the current system where the staff members have to continually re-enter data for a new consult each time they are unable to schedule a patient intra-VA network or extra-VA network.
